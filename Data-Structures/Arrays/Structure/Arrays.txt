When to use Arrays:
  - when you want to have an ordered list
  - when you need fast access / insertion and removal (sort of)

Big O of Arrays:
  - Insertion (depends)
    - .push() & .pop() from end -> O(1)
    - .shift() & .unshift() from front -> O(N) -> due to reindexing the array
  - Removal (depends)
    - Better from the end
    - Not good from the front
  - Searching O(N)
  - Access N(1)
